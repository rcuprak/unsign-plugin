# Gradle Unsign Plugin

This plugin unsigns JAR files in a directory. This is useful in situations where you need to re-sign the JAR for a WebStart application or need to be able to patch the JAR file for troubleshooting. 

To use this plugin, specify the directory in which you want the JAR signatures to be removed. For example, a web start application, you'll export all the JAR files to a directory. You can run this plugin first before then signing the JAR files.

Example project using this plugin will be released shortly.
